<h4>Tips</h4>  <!--Adding ordered list-->
<ol>

<li>To make it look more festive, you can garnish it with chopped almonds, cashews, or pistachios.</li>
<li>
  If you want the burfi to be richer, add 1 or 2 tbsp of heavy cream if desired.</li>
<li>For a softer burfi, switch off the flame faster and for a hard burfi cook it longer.</li>
<li>Don’t panic if you feel that you have removed the mixture too early and it did not set upon cooling. Just put the mixture back in the pan, stir for another 2 to 3 minutes, 
  and then set the burfi again.</li>
  <li>And if you are a bounty chocolate lover, you can simply stop cooking the coconut-sugar mixture five minutes after the sugar dissolves. Spread out the mixture to desired thickness and let it set in the refrigerator. Then, cut them into desired shapes. 
    Dip in melted chocolate and enjoy.</li>
