  <h1>Kheer Recipe</h1>
  <body>
      
    <P1>Kheer is an Indian dessert typically made by boiling milk, sugar and nuts along with rice. Sound familiar? It’s one dessert that has many versions around the world. Every culture has its own take on this classic, and for good reason: It’s delicious.
      This versatile dessert that can be served hot or cold. Although there are different types of kheer recipes in India—like payasam made with lentils, semolina kheer, vermicelli kheer, apple kheer, tapioca kheer, 
      almond kheer and even carrot kheer—the most popular kheer is made with rice and milk.</P1>


<h2><strong>Ingredients of Kheer</strong></h2>

<ul> <!--Adding unordered list-->
  <li>1 cup basmati or long grain white rice, washed and rinsed</li>
  <li>1/2 cup water</li>
  <li>1 cup unsweetened condensed milk or evaporated milk</li>
  <li>5 cups milk</li>
  <li>3/4 cup slivered almonds</li>
  <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
  <li>For the garnish, use a handful of sliced almonds and chopped pistachios, a pinch of cardamom powder and dried rose petals.</li>
</ul>

<P1>This simple recipe needs an electric pressure cooker, like an Instant Pot.
  You’ll need a ladle to stir and serve the kheer, along with a ladle rest to keep the counter clean.
  To measure the milk and condensed milk, keep a 1-quart Pyrex measuring cup handy.</P1>
	

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4> </strong>Combine the ingredients</strong>
<P>Heat the inner pot of an Instant Pot using the saute function. Add all the ingredients for kheer into the pot, starting with water, 
  followed by unsweetened condensed or evaporated milk, milk, nuts, cardamom powder and sugar.</P>


<h4>Step 2</h4> </strong>Cook the kheer</strong>
<P>Close the lid and seal the vent. Use the porridge mode for 20 minutes followed by a natural pressure release.
  Once the kheer is cooked, open the lid and give the contents a stir.
  You can adjust the consistency and sweetness of the kheer to your taste. If it’s too thick, gradually add milk to thin it out. If adding more milk, use the saute function again for about 5 minutes. If you like your kheer sweeter, add more sugar and mix well.</P>


<h4>Step 3</h4> </strong>Garnish</strong>
</P>Serve the kheer warm or cold—whichever you prefer! Garnish with chopped or sliced nuts and cardamom powder or rose petals just before serving. It’s an excellent dessert after an Indian meal of dishes like red lentil dal, chicken tikka masala and homemade naan.</P>
